          Context is a resource that contains shared information of installations.
          This includes information about the repository context like the context itself or secrets to access the oci artifacts.
          But it can also contain deployer specific config.
        properties:
          apiVersion:
            description: |-
              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

            description: |-
              ComponentVersionOverwritesReference is a reference to a ComponentVersionOverwrites object
              The overwrites object has to be in the same namespace as the context.

              Configurations contains arbitrary configuration information for dedicated purposes given by a string key.
              The key should use a dns-like syntax to express the purpose and avoid conflicts.

              Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
              Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
              Cannot be updated.
              In CamelCase.
