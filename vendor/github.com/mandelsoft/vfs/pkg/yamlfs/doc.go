// Package yamlfs provides a virtual filesystem based on the structure and
// content of a yaml document.
//
// Hereby maps are used to represent the directory hierarchy. Content of
// a field will be offered as file content.
// To represent more complex cases a map inclusing the field `$type` is
// not interpreted as directory by default, but according to the
// value of the type attribute.
// - type `directory`: the field `value` is used a directory content
// - type `file`: the field `value` is used as file content
// - type `symlink`: the field `value` is used symlink content
// - type `yaml`: the field  `value` is used to provide file content
//   that is provided as yaml file data (read and write)
// - type `json`: the field  `value` is used to provide file content
//   that is provided as json file data (read and write)
//
// string data starting with a line `---Start Binary---`and finished with a
// line ` ---End Binary---` interpretes the data in-between as bas64 encoded
// binary data. The latest version is able to handle binary data directly
// as described by the yaml format for reading and writing.
