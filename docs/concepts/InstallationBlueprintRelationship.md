# Installation-Blueprint relationship

This document describes the relationship between _Installations_, _Component-Descriptors_ and _Blueprints_.

Installations can reference blueprints in 2 different ways:

1. by a [component-descriptor reference](#componentdescriptor-reference)
2. by providing the blueprint [inline](#inline)

See the [installation docs](../usage/Installations.md#blueprint) for a detailed description of the resources.

## ComponentDescriptor reference

Blueprints are artifacts created during the build of a component. As such, they are included as a resource in a component's _Component-Descriptor_. 

In context of Landscaper, Blueprints (referenced in the Component-Descriptor as resource) can be referred to by specifying a Component-Descriptor and the resource within that points to the Blueprint.

Component-Descriptors are uniquely defined by the combination of the repository context they got pushed to, their name and their version. Within the Component-Descriptor, the Blueprint resource can be identified by its name (:warning: see the component descriptor model for a detailed description about a resource's identity).

```yaml
meta:
  schemaVersion: v2

component:
  name: github.com/gardener/landscaper/example
  version: v1.0.0

  [...]

  resources:
  - type: blueprint
    name: example-blueprint
    version: v1.0.0
    [...]
```

In this sample snippet of a Component-Descriptor, the Blueprint would be referred to by the respository context, the component name (i.e. `github.com/gardener/landscaper/example`), its version (i.e. `v1.0.0`) and the name of the Blueprint resource (i.e. `example-blueprint`).

### Access types

Every resource in a Component-Descriptor contains an `access` attribute that describes how the actual artifact - and thus the Blueprint - can be retrieved.

Currently, Landscaper supports two types of access:

#### 1. Artifact Reference

The Blueprint is described as its own OCI artifact and therefore is referred to by a fully qualified OCI artifact reference. The OCI manifest (the actual resource that describes an OCI artifact) contains the blueprint as first layer.

![blueprint artifact reference](../images/compdesc-blueprint-ref-relationship.png)

The OCI manifest of the Blueprint in this case would look like this:

```json
{
 "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
 "schemaVersion": 2,
 "layers": [
   {
     "digest": "sha256:efg",
     "mediaType": "application/tar+gz"
   }
 ]
}
```

Then the Blueprint resource in the Component-Descriptor would look like this:

```yaml
# blueprint resource within the component-descriptor
resources:
- name: myBlueprint
  type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/blueprint
  access:
    type: ociRegistry
    imageReference: eu.gcr.io/gardener/myBlueprint:v0.2.0
```

#### 2. Local OCI blob

The Blueprint is part of the Component-Descriptor's manifest on a seperate layer and is referenced by it's digest in the context of its Component-Descriptor.

![blueprint local reference](../images/comdesc-blueprint-ref-local.png)

The OCI manifest of the Component-Descriptor for example would look like this:

```json
{
 "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
 "schemaVersion": 2,
 "config": {
   "digest": "sha256:a123",
   "mediaType": "application/vnd.gardener.cloud.cnudie.component.config.v1+json"
 },
 "layers": [
   {
     "digest": "sha256:abc",
     "mediaType": "application/vnd.gardener.cloud.cnudie.component-descriptor.v2+json"
   },
   {
     "digest": "sha256:efg",
     "mediaType": "application/vnd.gardener.landscaper.blueprint.v1+tar+gzip"
   }
 ]
}
```

Then the Blueprint resource in the Component-Descriptor would look like this:

```yaml
# blueprint resource within the component-descriptor
resources:
- name: myBlueprint
  type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/blueprint
  access:
    type: localOCIBlob
    digest: sha256:efg
```

#### 3. Inline Blueprints

Blueprints can be also directly defined in the manifest of an installation. This can be useful for ad-hoc installations or for quick tests.

A component descriptor is optional for inline Blueprints, but can be used by specifying a component reference through `.spec.componentDescriptor.ref`. If a Component-Descriptor is referenced by an inline Blueprint, it will be  accessible the same way as if it were defined through a non-inline Blueprint.

![blueprint inline](../images/compdesc-blueprint-inline-relationship.png)

## Inline Component-Descriptors - for local testing only

To support a local development scenario and to enable easy testing of changes, the Component-Descriptor can be directly declared inline in an Installation resource as well.

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  componentDescriptor:
    inline:
      # full component descriptor spec goes here
  ...
```

Any artefacts described by an inline component descriptor has to be available at their specified location (e.g. as an inline Blueprint or in an OCI registry).
