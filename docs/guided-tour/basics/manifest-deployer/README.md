# Manifest Deployer Example

Let's have a closer look at the Manifest Deployer.

For prerequisites, see [here](../../README.md).

The Landscaper offers different deployers per default: 

- the [Helm Deployer](../../../deployer/helm.md)
- the [Kubernetes Manifest Deployer](../../../deployer/manifest.md), 
- and the [Container Deployer](../../../deployer/container.md).

We have already used the Helm deployer in the first Hello World Example to deploy a 
Helm Chart to create a ConfigMap on the target cluster.

In the current example, we will show how the same task can be achieved with the Kubernetes manifest deployer.
This deployer is great if you want to deploy some Kubernetes manifests without going the extra mile of building a 
Helm chart for these manifests. The Kubernetes manifests are directly included in the blueprint of the Installation.

Let's look at the blueprint of the [Installation](installation/installation.yaml). It contains one DeployItem:

```yaml
deployItems:
  - name: default-deploy-item
    type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-manifest
    config:  
      manifests:
        - manifest:
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: ConfigMap
            metadata:
              name: hello-world
              namespace: example
            data:
              testData: hello
```

The type `landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-manifest` tells Landscaper that the manifest deployer should be used to process the DeployItem. 
A DeployItem also contains a `config` section, and its structure depends on the DeployItem type. In case of the manifest deployer, 
the `config` section contains the list of Kubernetes manifests,which should be applied to the target cluster. 
In this example, the list contains one Kubernetes manifest for a ConfigMap.

## Procedure

1. In the [settings](commands/settings) file, adjust the variables `RESOURCE_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG_PATH`
   and `TARGET_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG_PATH`.

2. On the Landscaper resource cluster, create a namespace `cu-example`.

3. On the target cluster, create a namespace `example`.

4. Run script [commands/deploy-k8s-resources.sh](commands/deploy-k8s-resources.sh).
   It templates a [target.yaml.tpl](installation/target.yaml.tpl) and an [installation.yaml.tpl](installation/installation.yaml.tpl)
   and applies both on the resource cluster.

5. Wait until the Installation is in phase `Succeeded` and check that the ConfigMap was created.

## Cleanup

You can remove the Installation with the
[delete-installation script](commands/delete-installation.sh).
When the Installation is gone, you can delete the Target with the
[delete-other-k8s-resources script](commands/delete-other-k8s-resources.sh).
