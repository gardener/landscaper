# Target Map on Subinstallation Level

The example defined [here](component) deploys the same config maps on the target cluster as the others. The
difference is that it imports 3 targets as standard targets and in this
[Subinstallation](component/blueprint/sub/subinst.yaml) it converts these into a target map.
