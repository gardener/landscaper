# Reconciliation Flow

This document aims to describe what exactly happens during the reconciliation of a Landscaper resource. The goal is to describe it in a way that is easier to read and understand than (pseudo-)code, but still precise enough to be useful if detailed information abouth the different steps which build up the reconciliation is required. To help with this, the descriptions are enhanced with some symbols to better mark specific events. These symbols and their meanings are explained below.

Please note that errors can occur in most of the steps for various reasons. To not overload the descriptions with possible error messages, *the descriptions usually don't contain information on the possible errors*. This also means that even the steps not marked as potential exit points for the reconciliation flow might be able to abort the reconciliation in case of an error.

- 🚪
  - The door symbol means that the current flow is exited during this step. It usually corresponds to a `return` statement in the code. This symbol is used independently of whether the flow aborts with or without an error.
- ❔
  - The question mark stands for a conditional, where the following actions are determined by a specific check. It usually corresponds to an `if` statement in the code. Note that symbols listed directly after this one represent the potential for the event they stand for. An example: while 🚪 means that the current flow will be exited in the current step, ❔🚪 means that there is a check which *might* cause the end of the current flow, depending on the outcome of the check.
- ↪
  - The arrow means that another flow is started. It usually corresponds to a method call in the code. If not described otherwise, the current flow will continue after the subroutine has returned. The description of the step provides more information on which flow is started.
- ✔️
  - The check mark stands for 'action' and means that in this step, the most important part of the reconciliation flow is performed. The exact meaning depends on the type of resource which is being reconciled. For example, during the installation reconcile, the most important action would be the creation/update/deletion of the nested installations and executions. This is what the reconciliation is actually supposed to do, everything else around it is just there to ensure that this happens under the correct conditions.

## Installations

### Core Reconciliation Logic

The core reconciliation logic handles some general checks to determine the type of reconciliation which needs to be performed (reconciliation, force-reconciliation, deletion, ...).

1. Check for ignore annotation ❔🚪

    If the installation is in a final phase and has the ignore annotation, the reconciliation is aborted. 🚪

2. Add finalizer ❔🚪

    If the installation has neither a deletion timestamp nor a landscaper finalizer, a landscaper finalizer is added and the reconciliation is aborted. 
  Adding the finalizer will cause a new reconciliation. 🚪

3. Check for deletion ❔↪🚪

    If the installation has a deletion timestamp, the deletion flow is started. ↪🚪

4. Check for operation annotation ❔↪🚪

    If the installation has an operation annotation, it is evaluated now: the reconcile operation annotation will cause a 'standard' reconcile ↪🚪, and the force-reconcile annotation will cause a 'force' reconcile ↪🚪. The abort annotation is meant to abort the installation, but this is currently not implemented.

5. Check for changes in nested installations ❔🚪

    If the installation is in a final phase and has not been modified (`.status.observedGeneration` == `.metadata.generation`), it is checked whether there have been changes in its nested installations. This updates the phase of the installation and, if it is now `Succeeded`, will trigger other installation which depend on this one by adding the reconcile operation annotation to them. The reconciliation is aborted afterwards 🚪, but if a phase change happened, this will trigger a new reconciliation.

6. Now a 'standard' reconcile will happen. ↪

### Standard Reconciliation

This is the default reconciliation logic.

1. Compute combined phase

    The phases of all nested installations and executions are aggregated to determine the current state. The combined phase will only be `Succeeded` if all nested phases are `Succeeded`.

2. Evaluate combined phase ❔🚪

    If the combined phase is empty, there are neither nested installations nor executions and the phase is set to `Succeeded` by default.
    
    If the combined phase is not a final phase, the installation's phase is set to `Progressing` and the reconciliation is aborted. The installation needs to wait for its nested resources to be completed first. 🚪

3. Check for abort operation annotation ❔🚪

    If the installation has the abort operation annotation, its phase is set to `Aborted` and the reconciliation is aborted. 🚪

4. Check if an update is required ❔🚪

    If neither the installation itself nor any of its imports has been modified, there is no need to trigger the nested installations and executions. This is checked by comparing generation values with stored 'observed' generation values, the latter of which are updated when a new generation is observed. For imports which are exported by another installation, the generation is read from the exporting installation's status. For imports which are not owned by an installation, it is usually a hash over their respective spec, although the implementations slightly differ, depending on the type of import.
 
   If an update is required, the installation's phase is set to `PendingDependencies` and it is checked whether the installation can be updated now.
    
    1. Check if updating is possible ❔✔️🚪

        There are several requirements which need to be fulfilled before the installation can update its nested installations and executions:
          - all installations which is depended on need to be
            - in phase `Succeeded`
            - up-to-date (`.status.observedGeneration` == `.metadata.generation`)
            - not queued for reconciliation by the reconcile or force-reconcile operation annotation
          - if the installation has a parent installation, the parent has to be in phase `Progressing`
          - all imports need to be satisfied, which means they have to
            - exist
            - be imported by the parent or be exported by a sibling, if they are owned by an installation
        
        If all of these are fulfilled, the nested installations and executions are updated. ✔️
        
        Otherwise, the installation will be stuck in `PendingDependencies` and log a corresponding error message. 🚪

5. Export generation

    The exports are generated.

6. Trigger depending installations

    All sibling installations which depend on this one are triggered by having the reconcile operation annotation added.


### Force Reconciliation

A force reconciliation only happens if the corresponding operation annotation has been added to the installation. Since it is clear in this case that an update is desired, most of the checks of the standard reconciliation are skipped in this flow. Most noticable, it is possible to update an installation despite installations the current one depends on being `Failed` or `Progressing`.

1. Check if imports are satisfied ❔🚪

    As for the standard reconciliation, imports have to
      - exist
      - be imported by the parent or be exported by a sibling, if they are owned by an installation

    If not fulfilled, the installation will be stuck in `PendingDependencies` and log a corresponding error message. 🚪

2. Update nested installations and executions ✔️

3. Remove operation annotation

4. Set phase

    The phase of the installation is set to `Progressing` and its observed generation is updated to match its generation.


### Deletion

This reconciliation flow is executed if the installation has a deletion timestamp.

1. Check for force-reconcile operation annotation ❔✔️🚪

    If the installation has a force-reconcile operation annotation, most of the checks for the normal deletion flow are skipped:
    
    1. Update nested installations and executions ✔️

        This is to make sure that all nested installations and executions are up-to-date. It will fail with an error if updating is currently not possible.

    2. Delete nested installations and executions ✔️

        This step deletes all nested resources belonging to the installation. It also propagates the force-reconcile operation annotation to them.

        If all nested resources are gone, the finalizer is removed from the installation.
    
    3. Remove operation annotation 🚪

2. Check for sibling imports ❔🚪

    If there is any sibling which imports something that is exported by this installation, the deletion will abort with an error. 🚪

3. Compute combined phase

    The phases of all nested installations and executions are aggregated to determine the current state.

4. Shortcut deletion for empty installations ❔🚪

    If the combined phase is empty, this means there are neither nested installations nor executions. In this case, the finalizer is removed from the installation and the deletion is finished. 🚪

5. Evaluate combined phase ❔🚪

    If the combined phase is not a final phase, the deletion needs to wait for the nested resources to finish. The phase is set to `Deleting` and the reconciliation is aborted. 🚪

6. Check if an update is required ❔🚪

    It is checked whether the installation or one of its imports has been updated since the last reconciliation. This is done in the same way as explained in step 4 of the standard reconciliation flow.

    If an update is required, it is checked whether all imports are satisfied. This works as described in step 1 of the force reconciliation flow. If that is the case, the nested resources are updated, otherwise the reconciliation is aborted 🚪.

7. Delete nested installations and executions ✔️

    See step 1.2 for a description (except for the propagation of the force-reconcile operation annotation).


## DeployItems

DeployItems are not reconciled by the Landscaper - except for timeout checking - but by dedicated deployers. The reconciliation flow for deployers depends on what the deployer is actually meant to do and cannot be described in general. Although, there is a [contract](./deployer_contract.md) and a description of the [common reconciliation logic](../development/dep-lib-extension-hooks.md#default-reconciliation-flow) implemented in the deployer library.

The section below describes the reconciliation flow which is performed by the landscaper itself. As mentioned, it only checks for timeouts and reacts on them.

For a detailed description of the different timeouts, please have a look at [DeployItem Timeouts](../usage/DeployItemTimeouts.md).

### Core Reconciliation Logic

1. Check for pickup timeout ❔↪🚪

    If a pickup timeout is configured, it is checked whether it occurred and the deployitem status is updated if it was changed.

2. Check for aborting timeout ❔↪🚪

    If an aborting timeout is configured, it is checked whether it occurred and the deployitem status is updated if it was changed.

    The annotations of the deployitem are updated too, if they changed.

3. Check for progressing timeout ❔↪

    If a progressing timeout is configured, it is checked whether it occurred. There is a default, which is configurable in the landscaper config, and a field in the deployitem spec, which takes precedence over the default, if set. 

    The annotations of the deployitem are updated, if they changed.

4. Requeue deployitem

    The deployitem is requeued to check for potential timeouts. Each of the three previous steps potentially returns a duration after which the deployitem should be requeued and the minimum of these values is used. If none of the steps actually returned a value, the deployitem is not requeued.


### Detect Pickup Timeouts

This is the flow for detecting pickup timeouts.

1. Check if already timed out ❔🚪

    If the deployitem is already failed with a pickup timeout, there is nothing to do.

2. Check for reconcile timestamp annotation ❔🚪

    If the deployitem doesn't have a reconcile timestamp annotation, there is nothing to do.

    The reconcile timestamp annotation is set by the execution controller when the deployitems are created/updated.

3. Check for timeout ❔

    If the period between the time of the timestamp and the current time is equal or greater than the specified timeout duration, a pickup timeout occurred:
    
      1. Set phase to `Failed`

      2. Set last error to pickup timeout

4. Compute requeue time

    The requeue time for the deployitem is computed to be 5 seconds after the expected timeout time.


### Detect Aborting Timeouts

This is the flow for detecting aborting timeouts.

1. Check if already timed out ❔🚪

    If the deployitem is already failed with an aborting timeout, there is nothing to do.

2. Check for abort timestamp and phase ❔🚪

    If the deployitem doesn't have an abort timestamp or is in a final phase, there is nothing to do.

3. Check for timeout ❔

    If the period between the time of the timestamp and the current time is equal or greater than the specified timeout duration, an aborting timeout occurred:
    
      1. Set phase to `Failed`

      2. Set last error to aborting timeout

4. Compute requeue time

    The requeue time for the deployitem is computed to be 5 seconds after the expected timeout time.


### Detect Progressing Timeouts

This is the flow for detecting progressing timeouts.

1. Check if timeout is possible ❔🚪

    If the last reconcile time in the deployitem status is empty - indicating that the deployitem has never been picked up by a deployer before - or the deployitem is in a final phase, there is nothing to do.

2. Check for timeout ❔🚪

    If the period between the time of the last reconcile timestamp and the current time is equal or greater than the specified timeout duration, a progressing timeout occurred:
    
      1. Add the abort operation annotation to the deployitem

      2. Add the abort timeout annotation to the deployitem

3. Compute requeue time

    The requeue time for the deployitem is computed to be 5 seconds after the expected timeout time.
