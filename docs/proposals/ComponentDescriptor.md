# Component Descriptor

The ComponentDescriptor is the BOM(Bill of Materials) of a Component(Definition?) that contains all dependencies and their versions.

Dependencies can be of a specific type/kind whereas all kinds of dependencies should be supportable.
By now the planned types are `Images`, `OCI Helm Charts` and `ComponentDefinitions`.

The ComponentDescriptor also contains overwrites that can be used to overwrite the location (maybe also version) of a dependency.
To support this feature, all dependencies must have a unique name which is used to reference the type specific dependency information.

*Goals*:
- Dev dependencies -> overwrite versions of dependencies 
  - Problem: may need also a dev version of the parent (mappings in the parents definition) or the actual installation mappings
  - Worst case: need own dev version of parent
- Dependencies in restricted environments
  - The Landscaper should be able to consume dependencies from another OCI registry.
- Dependencies should be somehow specified in the imports/ComponentDefinition?
- Deployers/DeployItems must have access to the dependencies and their (maybe) overwritten locations/info.
- Component specific dependencies

*Assumptions*:

```yaml
type: Installation
spec:
    blueprintRef:
      baseUrl: eu.gcr.io/...
      type: ociRegistry | local | ...
      component/ref: my-other-def
      version: x.x.x
      kind: localResource
      resourceName: my-blueprint
```

```yaml
kind: Blueprint

name: my-def
version: 0.5.0

import:
- key: etcd
  component:
    ref: github.com/gardener/mcm
    kind: externalResource
    resource: etcd
    type: ociImage


blueprintRefs:
- name: abc
  blueprintRef:
    component/ref: my-other-def
    kind: localResource
    resource: blueprint
- name: cde
  blueprintRef:
    component/ref: my-other-def
    kind: localResource
    resource: blueprint
```

```yaml
type: DeployItem
executors:
- type: helm
  config:
    image: {{ imports.etcd.access.imageReference }}
    image2: {{ compdesc."github.com/gardener/mcm".resources.etcd.access.ImageReference }}
```

- the root installation specifies the component from where the component descriptor is fetched and the blueprint resource in this component desc.
  - make base url in the installation configurable
- aggregated blueprints specify only the blueprint's component and blueprints location (kind: local/external and name)
  - subinstallation blueprint's components have to be defined as componentReference in the aggregated component descriptor.
  - the baseUrl is automatically given by the repository Context of the aggregated component
  - this basUrl is then also propagated to the sub installations
  
- local or external resources of a component can be accessed via import declartion with referece/componentName, kind and resourceName.
- the landscaper also translated the components, the local and external resources in to a map so that one can access it by index (no need to for looping over the resources array).

<hr>

Old component descriptor
- ComponentDefinitions and their Refs have to state the unique identifier of the Definition not the actual ref. `e.g. "gardener:1.0.0" not "eu.gcr.io/my-proj/gardener:1.0.0"`
- Installations may contain the real ref.

**Ideas**:

_Separate File_:<br>
Pro:
- Use already existing and needed ComponentDescriptor File
- Have dependencies separated from runtime values.
- Better handling in component as a common extensible descriptor is used to describe dependecies (we need to have that at least for private cloud deployments).
Con:
- need to maintain an additional object in the registry
- new first class citizen entity in the landscaper

_As Import_:<br>
Pro:
- use existing import validation
Con:
- additional maintenance of dependencies in the ComponentDescriptor and the ComponentDefinition
- whole lot of new imports that need to be maintained and mapped in aggregations
- translation of ComponentDescriptor to imports (how can be do the mapping?)


### New ComponentDescriptor structure

- flatten dependencies into a list; add `type`-attr
- add a metadata/version attr (+ be backwards-compatible)
- document the component_descriptor
- factor out documentation + bindings to a separate repository
- 2nd step: allow non-github-repository-bound components as toplevel-components (or rather: make all components toplevel-components)
