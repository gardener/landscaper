# Landscaper Service

The motivation of the landscaper service is to host multiple isolated landscaper installations in a single Kubernetes cluster that can be used by different tenants.

## Architecture

An instance of the landscaper service is installed within a namespace of a _hosting cluster_.
The landscaper service is contained in the [landscaper-service](../../.landscaper/landscaper-service) component.

* The landscaper service component uses the `virtual garden` component as a component reference.
The virtual garden component installs an etcd, Kube API server and Kube controller manager. The API server creates a _virtual cluster_. The name virtual is used here, because, it is node-less and no deployments can be created within the virtual cluster. Its purpose is to create/manage landscaper resources within the virtual cluster.

* The `RBAC blueprint` installs the required Kubernetes RBAC resources in the virtual cluster.

* The `landscaper blueprint` installs the landscaper controller and the landscaper webhooks server.

* The `installation blueprint` contains the virtual garden, RBAC and landscaper blueprint as subinstallations and installs them in the correct order.

## Installation

The landscaper service can be installed by creating an installation of the `installation blueprint`.

### Target Cluster

The installation requires a target of type `landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-cluster` which specifies the hosting cluster into which the landscaper service will be installed. See [this documentation](../technical/target_types.md) on how to create a target resource.

### OCI Secrets

The OCI registry secrets can be specified as a Kubernetes secret.
The secret must contain secret data in the docker auth format.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-oci-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  default: |
    {
      "auths": {
        "https://oci.acme.cloud": {
          "auth": "Zm9vOmJhcg=="
        }
      }
    }
```

### Installation

The landscaper service can be installed by creating an `installation` which references to the `installation-blueprint` of the `github.com/gardener/landscaper` component.
The following example shows the configuration of the landscaper service installation.

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Installation

  # The landscaper service exports two data objects.
  # "landscaperClusterEndpoint" is the API server endpoint at which the landscaper is available.
  # "landscaperClusterKubeconfig" is the Kubernets kubeconfig which can be used to connect to the API server.
  exports:
    data:
    - name: landscaperClusterEndpoint
      dataRef: landscaperClusterEndpoint
    - name: landscaperClusterKubeconfig
      dataRef: landscaperClusterKubeconfig
```

The installation exports two string data objects:
1. `landscaperClusterEndpoint` is the endpoint of the virtual cluster API server at which the landscaper available.
2. The `landscaperClusterKubeconfig` is a base 64 encoded kubeconfig file which can be used to connect to the virtual cluster API server as a landscaper user.
The landscaper user has permissions to create landscaper resources, secrets, configmaps and namespaces in the virtual cluster.
