# Prepare demo environment

You need to have:

- 1 Kubernetes cluster under your control
- Latest version of landscaper-cli and component-cli installed

## The K8S cluster

There are several ways to get a K8S cluster, we prefer to use Gardener Kubernetes clusters.

Go here: <https://dashboard.garden.canary.k8s.ondemand.com/login> to get a Gardener Kubernetes Cluster (trial).

When you create the Gardener Kubernetes cluster, ensure the following:

- Length of cluster name should not exceed 5 letters, e.g. "demo"
- In the Add-ons section, select the "Nginx Ingress" (Default ingress-controller with static configuration...)

## The tools

Install the Landscaper CLI with the [installation instructions](https://github.com/gardener/landscapercli/blob/master/docs/installation.md) which will include Component CLI as well or do a manual binary download like describes bewlow.
