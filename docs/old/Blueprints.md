# Blueprint

A Blueprint describes the steps that are necessary to deploy a component. 
These steps are described by either Executors or references to other Blueprints.

A ComponentDefinition is a `tar+gz` with the below structure.
- The ComponentDefinition **must** be included in the top-level dir with the name `blueprint.yaml`
- Additional references that are included in the component can be referenced in the top-level Blueprint
  - References can reference a remote Blueprint by specifying the `blueprintRef` in the BlueprintReference
  - Additionally local definitions can be defined by adding another Blueprint next to the reference
```
my-comp
├── references
│   └── comp-ref
│       ├── [optional] configfiles.yaml
│       ├── [optional] definition.yaml
│       └── reference.yaml
└── blueprint.yaml
```

## Executors and Aggregations

### Executors

A Definition may contain any number of Executors. They are provided as one single string in `.executors`. While processing the Definition, the string is templated, after which it should be a valid YAML list, and then stored in the cluster as an `Execution` CR. Executors are processed in the given order, but in parallel with referenced Definitions. See the [Executor documentation](Executors.md) for further information.

```yaml
executors: |
- name: deploy-chart
  type: helm
  config:
    chartRepository: my-repo
    version: 1.0.0
    values: {{ .exports.mykey.x }}
    valueRef:
      secretRef: abc
```

*Example*


### Aggregations

A Blueprint can aggregate any number of other Blueprints by referencing them in `.blueprintRefs`.
To map the imports of the surrounding Definition to their inner definitions, a mapping is needed.
The mapping can be defined for each component for their imports and exports.

```yaml
blueprintRefs:
- ref: my-sub-component:1.0.0
  imports:
  - from: abc
    to: yxz
  exports:
  - from: abc
    to: yxz
```

*Example*


## Installations

Blueprints are not deployed into the cluster. Instead, a Installation is deployed which references the corresponding Blueprint. 
If the referenced Blueprint aggregates other Blueprints, their corresponding Installations will be created automatically.
The user only needs to deploy the top-level Installation(s). 
See the [documentation on Installations](Installations.md) for details.

## Registry

Blueprints are referenced by installations with their unique name and version.
This name in combination with the version is then used by the landscaper to fetch the Definition from a registry.

Currently, a local and OCI registry are supported.
Be aware that a local reigstry should be only used for testing and development, whereas the OCI registry is the preferred productive way.


### Local

A local registry can be defined in the landscaper configuration by providing the below configuration.
The landscaper expects the given paths to be a directory that contains the definitions in subdirectory.
The subdirectory should contain the file `description.yaml`, that contains the actual ComponentDefinition with its version and name.
The whole subdirectory is used as the blob content of the Component.
```yaml
apiVersion: config.landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: LandscaperConfiguration

registry:
  local:
    paths:
    - "/path/to/definitions"
```

### OCI

ComponentDefinitions can be stored in a OCI compliant registry which is the preferred way to create and offer CompoentnDefinitions.
The Landscaper uses [OCI Artifacts](https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts) which means that a OCI compliant registry has to be used.
For more information about the [OCI distribution spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/master/spec.md) and OCI compliant registries refer to the official documents.

The OCI manifest are stored in the below format in the registry.
Whereas the config contains the actual `ComponentDefinition` and the layers 
 - must contain a componentdescriptor of type `application/vnd.gardener.componentdescriptor.v2+json`
 - can contain a content blob of type `application/tar+gzip`
 
 The layers can be identified via their title annotation or via their media type as only one component descriptor per layer is allowed.
```json
{
   "schemaVersion": 2,
   "annotations": {},
   "config": {},
   "layers": [
      {
         "digest": "sha256:6f4e69a5ff18d92e7315e3ee31c62165ebf25bfa05cad05c0d09d8f412dae401",
         "mediaType": "application/tar+gzip",
         "size": 78343,
         "annotations": {
            "org.opencontainers.image.title": "definition"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
