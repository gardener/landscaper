# Templating

## Definition
Landscaper uses templating to dynamically generate configurations based on a given data binding for various purposes. An example is the generation of deployitem manifests based on the imports of a blueprint. 
The Landscaper supports multiple [template engines](#template-engines). Depending on the purpose, dedicated value bindings are provided as input for the templating. Templating is executed in so-called 'executions', defining the context for the templating. Landscaper uses executions for:
- [**`deployExecutions`**](./Blueprints.md#deployitem-templates) for rendering deployitems
- [**`exportExecutions`**](./Blueprints.md#export-templates) for rendering exports
- [**`subinstallationExecutions`**](./Blueprints.md#installation-templates) for rendering nested installations

For each of these purposes, a list of executions can be specified. Every execution can use a different template engine. The results of all specified executions with the same purpose will be merged. 

For detailed information of blueprints see the [Blueprint Docs](./Blueprints.md).

## Template Execution

Landscaper uses templating for various purposes, most prominently in the blueprint (e.g. for deployitem and export generation). The dedicated section in the respective manifests is always a list of template execution configurations. Each execution is defined by a set of attributes:
- **`name`** *string*
  The _name_ is used for providing error messages during the templating execution. It is also used as an identifier for the [state](#state-handling) of the execution.

- **`type`** *string*
  The _type_ specifies which template engine should be used. Currently supported types are [`GoTemplate`](#go-template) and [`Spiff`](#spiff).

- **`file`** *string* [optional]
  If this property is set, the template is read from the specified file of the blueprint file structure. Exactly one of `file` and `template` has to be specified.

- **`template`** *template* [optional]
  If this property is set, the template is read from the given inline data, according to the specification of the specified template engine type. Exactly one of `file` and `template` has to be specified.

The the rendered output of the templating must always be a YAML document. The document is expected to be a map. The structure is the same, independent of which template engine is used. The expected result is always read from a dedicated key, depending on the execution (e.g. `deployItems` for deployitem executions).

**Example**
```yaml
deployExecutions:
- name: my-spiff-template
  type: Spiff
  template:
    deployItems:
    - name: my-first-deploy-item
      type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/mock
      config: ...
- name: my-go-template
  type: GoTemplate
  template: |
    deployitems:
    - name: my-second-deploy-item
      type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/mock
      config: ...
```

## Filesystem

The blueprint's filesystem structure is accessible for the template engines as root file system.

Depending on what is being rendered, there is more data available during the templating, such as imports, etc..
The available bindings are described in the docs belonging to the resource the templates are part of, e.g. [here](./Blueprints.md#rendering) for the templates in blueprints.

**Example**
- Filesystem
  ```
  my-blueprint
  ├── data
  │   ├── template
  │   └── config
  └── blueprint.yaml
  ```
- Execution snippet from blueprint.yaml
  ```yaml
  - name: my-go-template
    type: GoTemplate
    file: "data/template"
  ```
- Template file
  ```
  deployitems:
    - name: my-second-deploy-item
      type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/mock
      config:
  {{ include "data/config" . | indent 6 }}
  ```


## State Handling

Depending on the purpose of the execution, Landscaper supports state handling. An execution can provide information that should be kept among multiple evaluations of the execution (e.g. when the installation is updated). The mechanism, how the state is past to and read from an execution depends on its template engine.


## Template Engines

The Landscaper currently supports two template engines:
- [**`GoTemplate`**](#go-template) [Go Template]((https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)) enhanced with [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) functions.
- [**`Spiff`**](#spiff) [Spiff++](https://github.com/mandelsoft/spiff) templating.

Regardless of the chosen engine, the output is always expected to have the same structure.

:warning: Note that OS functions are not available for security reasons.


### Go Template

The execution type to use for go templates is `GoTemplate`. As go templates are not valid YAML, they have to be provided as a string. Because this is typically a multi-line string, the `|` notation is mostly used.

**Example**
```yaml
- name: my-go-template
  type: GoTemplate
  template: |
    deployitems:
    - name: my-second-deploy-item
      type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/mock
      config: {{ .imports.config }}
```

#### Additional Functions

The `GoTemplate` executor simply is standard [go template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) enhanced with [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) functions.

The following additional functions are available:

- **`include(path string, binding interface{}): string`**
  reads and executes a template from the given file with the provided binding (similar to helm's 'include') 
- **`readFile(path string): []byte`**
  reads a file from the blueprints filesystem
- **`readDir(path string): []FileInfo`**
  returns all files and directories in the given directory of the blueprint's filesystem.
- **`toYaml(interface{}): string`**
  converts the given object to valid yaml
- **`getResource(ComponentDescriptor, keyValuePairs ...string): Resource`**
  searches a resource in the given component descriptors that matches the specified selector. The selector are key-value pairs that describe the resource's identity.
  e.g. `getResource .cd "name" "myResource"` -> returns the resource with the name `myResource`
- **`getComponent(componentDescriptor, keyValuePairs ...string): ComponentDescriptor`**
  searches a component in the given component descriptors that matches the specified selector. The selector are key-value pairs that describe the component reference's identity.
  e.g. `getComponent .cd "name" "myComp"` -> seraches in the component descriptor for a component reference with the name `myComp` and returns the referenced component descriptor.
- **`getRepositoryContext(componentDescriptor): RepositoryContext`**
  returns the effective repository context of the given component descriptor
- **`parseOCIRef(ref string): [2]string`**
  parses an oci reference and returns the repository and the version.
  e.g. `host:5000/myrepo/myimage:1.0.0` -> `["host:5000/myrepo/myimage", "1.0.0"]`
- **`ociRefRepo(ref string): string`**
  parses an oci reference and returns the repository.
  e.g. `host:5000/myrepo/myimage:1.0.0` -> `"host:5000/myrepo/myimage"`
- **`ociRefVersion(ref string): string`**
  parses an oci reference and returns the version.
  e.g. `host:5000/myrepo/myimage:1.0.0` -> `"1.0.0"`
- **`resolve(access Access): []byte`**
  resolves an artifact defined by a typed access definition.
   The resolve function is currently able to handle artifacts of type `ociRegistry`, others may be added in the future.
   The function always returns a byte array of the artifact response
   ```
   # e.g for a oci registry artifact
   type: ociRegistry
   imageReference: host:5000/myrepo/myimage:1.0.0
   ```
  
- **`getShootAdminKubeconfig(shootName, shootNamespace string, expirationSeconds int, target Target): string`**  
  returns a temporary admin kubeconfig for a Gardener Shoot cluster as described 
  [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/shoot_access.md#shootsadminkubeconfig-subresource). 
  The kubeconfig is returned as base64 encoded string.  

  Arguments:
  - `shootName` the name of the shoot cluster
  - `shootNamespace` the namespace of the Gardener project to which the Shoot belongs: `garden-<PROJECT NAME>`
  - `expirationSeconds` the number of seconds after which the kubeconfig expires
  - `target` a Target that contains a kubeconfig for the Gardener project to which the Shoot belongs

  Here is an example of an export execution that uses the `getShootAdminKubeconfig` function. 
  ```yaml
  export-execution.yaml: |
    exports:
      {{- $kubeconfig := getShootAdminKubeconfig .imports.shootName .imports.shootNamespace 86400 .imports.gardenerServiceAccount | b64dec }}
      shootAdminKubeconfig: |
        {{- nindent 4 $kubeconfig }}
      shootAdminTarget:
        type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-cluster
        config:
          kubeconfig: |
            {{- nindent 8 $kubeconfig }}
  ```
  It constructs two export values: `shootAdminKubeconfig` returns the kubeconfig as string, and `shootAdminTarget` 
  returns the kubeconfig wrapped in a Target. You can find the full example 
  [here](https://github.com/gardener/landscaper-examples/tree/master/manifest-deployer/shoot-admin-kubeconfig).  

- **`getShootAdminKubeconfigWithExpirationTimestamp(shootName, shootNamespace string, expirationSeconds int, target Target): object`**
  works like `getShootAdminKubeconfig`, but instead of only returning the kubeconfig as string, it returns a struct containing the kubeconfig as well as the expiration timestamp of the token used in it. The returned struct looks like this:
  ```yaml
  kubeconfig: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Config
    ...
  expirationTimestamp: 1695369282 # seconds from epoch
  expirationTimestampReadable: "2023-09-22 09:54:42+02:00" # RFC3339
  ```

- **`getServiceAccountKubeconfig(serviceAccountName, serviceAccountNamespace string, expirationSeconds int, target Target): string`**
  returns a kubeconfig for a cluster. The kubeconfig will contain a token obtained by a 
  [token request](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-request-v1/) 
  for the specified ServiceAccount. The kubeconfig is returned as base64 encoded string.

  Arguments:
  - `serviceAccountName` the name of the ServiceAccount
  - `serviceAccountNamespace` the namespace of the ServiceAccount
  - `expirationSeconds` the number of seconds after which the kubeconfig expires
  - `target` a Target that contains a kubeconfig for the cluster

  Example:
  ```yaml
  export-execution.yaml: |
    exports:
      {{- $kubeconfig := getServiceAccountKubeconfig .imports.serviceAccountName .imports.serviceAccountNamespace 7776000 .imports.cluster | b64dec }}
      serviceAccountKubeconfig: |
        {{- nindent 4 $kubeconfig }}
      serviceAccountTarget:
        type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-cluster
        config:
          kubeconfig: |
            {{- nindent 8 $kubeconfig }}
  ```
  You can find the full example
  [here](https://github.com/gardener/landscaper-examples/tree/master/manifest-deployer/service-account-kubeconfig).

- **`getServiceAccountKubeconfigWithExpirationTimestamp(serviceAccountName, serviceAccountNamespace string, expirationSeconds int, target Target): object`**
  works like `getServiceAccountKubeconfig`, but instead of only returning the kubeconfig as string, it returns a struct containing the kubeconfig as well as the expiration timestamp of the token used in it. The returned struct looks like this:
  ```yaml
  kubeconfig: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Config
    ...
  expirationTimestamp: 1695369282 # seconds from epoch
  expirationTimestampReadable: "2023-09-22 09:54:42+02:00" # RFC3339
  ```


#### State

Old state is provided via an additional `state` binding. New state is taken from the `state` node of the rendered template, if it exists.

**Example**
```yaml
- name: my-go-template
  type: GoTemplate
  template: |
    state: {{if .state}}{{add .state 1}}{{else}}1{{end}}
    deployitems:
    - name: my-second-deploy-item
      type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/mock
      config: {{ .imports.config }}
```



### Spiff

The execution type to use for spiff templates is `Spiff`. The template can be provided as either YAML or text.

**Example**
```yaml
- name: my-spiff-template
  type: Spiff
  template:
    deployItems:
    - name: my-first-deploy-item
      type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/mock
      config: (( imports.config ))
```
or
```yaml
- name: my-spiff-template
  type: Spiff
  template: |
    deployItems:
    - name: my-first-deploy-item
      type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/mock
      config: (( imports.config ))
```

##### State

Spiff already has state handling implemented, see [here](https://github.com/mandelsoft/spiff#-state-) for details.
