# Kubernetes Manifest Deployer

The kubernetes manifest deployer is a controller that reconciles DeployItems of type `landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-manifest`.
It deploys the configured kubernetes manifest into the target cluster.

It also checks by default the health of the deployed resources. See [healthchecks.md](healthchecks.md) for more info.

## Provider Configuration

This sections describes the provider specific configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha2
kind: DeployItem

  name: my-manifests
spec:
  type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-manifest

  target: # has to be of type landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-cluster
    import: my-cluster

  # Defines the global timeout value. When the deployment (including readiness-checks and exports) takes
  # longer than this specified time, the deployment will be considered failed. Default: 10 minutes
  timeout: 20m

    apiVersion: manifest.deployer.landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha2
    kind: ProviderConfiguration

        disabled: false
        # a specific resource should be selected for this readiness check to be performed on
        # a resource is uniquely defined by its GVK, namespace and name

        - jsonPath: .status.readyReplicas

          # allowed operators are: DoesNotExist(!), Exists(exists), Equals(=, ==), NotEquals(!=), In(in), NotIn(notIn)
          operator: In
          # values is a list of values that the field at jsonPath must match to according to the operators

### Update Strategy

The update strategy defines the behavior of the manifest deployer when a resource for a rendered manifest already exists on the target cluster.

- `update`: The resources on the cluster will be updated with the results of the rendered manifests (default). Any changes to the resources, applied externally on the cluster, may be lost after the update.
- `patch`: The manifest deployer will calculate a JSON diff between the resources on the cluster and the rendered manifests. The diff will be applied as a patch. Any changes to the resources, applied externally on the cluster, may be lost after the update.
- `merge`: The manifest deployer will merge the results of the rendered manifests into the resources on the cluster. Fields that already exist in the resources on the cluster, will not be overwritten.
- `mergeOverwrite`: The manifest deployer will merge the results of the rendered manifests into the resources on the cluster. Fields that already exist in the resources on the cluster, will be overwritten when the rendered field is not empty.

### Policy

- `manage`: The manifest will be created, updated and deleted (occupies already managed resources).
- `fallback`: The manifest will be created, updated and deleted (only if not already managed by someone else: check for annotation with landscaper identity, deployitem name + namespace)
- `keep`: The manifest will be created, updated, but not deleted.
- `ignore`: The manifest will be completely ignored.
- `immutable`: The manifest will be created and deleted, but never updated. 

### Deletion Groups

The deletion behaviour is described in
[Deletion of Manifest and Manifest-Only Helm DeployItems](./manifest_deletion.md).

## Provider Status

This section describes the provider specific status of the resource

```yaml
status:
  providerStatus:
    apiVersion: manifest.deployer.landscaper.gardener.cloud
    kind: ProviderStatus
    managedResources:
    - apiGroup: k8s.apigroup.com/v1
      kind: my-type
      name: my-resource
      namespace: default
```

## Deployer Configuration

When deploying the manifest deployer controller it can be configured using the `--config` flag and providing a configuration file.

The structure of the provided configuration file is defined as follows.

:warning: Keep in mind that when deploying with the helm chart the configuration is abstracted using the helm values. See the [helm values file](../../charts/manifest-deployer/values.yaml) for details when deploying with the helm chart.
```yaml
apiVersion: manifest.deployer.landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration

# target selector to only react on specific deploy items.
# see the common config in "./README.md" for detailed documentation.
targetSelector:
  annotations: []
  labels: []
```
