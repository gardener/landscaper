# Helm Deployer

The helm deployer is a controller that reconciles DeployItems of type `landscaper.gardener.cloud/helm`. There are two
alternative working modes of the helm deployer. One renders a given helm chart and deploys the resulting manifest into 
a cluster. The other deploys a helm chart with [helm 3](https://helm.sh/). The second case is the default.

By default, the helm deployer checks the health of the deployed resources. See [healthchecks.md](healthchecks.md) for more info.

## Provider Configuration

This sections describes the provider specific configuration. The following example defines a deployment which deploys
a helm chart with helm 3. 

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: DeployItem
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/helm
  
  target: # has to be of type landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-cluster
    import: my-cluster

  # Defines the global timeout value. When the deployment (including readiness-checks and exports) takes
  # longer than this specified time, the deployment will be considered failed. Default: 10 minutes
  timeout: 20m

  config:
    apiVersion: helm.deployer.landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
    kind: ProviderConfiguration
    
    chart:
      # This section describes where to find the helm chart. Either ref of archive but not both are allowed.
      # Below you find a third possibility to reference a helm chart stored in a helm chart repository.
      
      # Reference to a helm chart stored in an OCI registry as an OCI artefact.
      # see https://helm.sh/blog/storing-charts-in-oci/
      ref: myrepo.example.com/charts/nginx-ingress:0.5.2 
      
      # base64 encoded helm chart tar.gz
      archive:
        raw: "" 

    # settings for the different helm 3 operations 
    helmDeploymentConfig:

        disabled: false
        # a specific resource should be selected for this readiness check to be performed on
        # a resource is uniquely defined by its GVK, namespace and name
        # required if no labelSelector is specified, can be combined with a labelSelector which is potentially harmful
        resourceSelector:
          apiVersion: apps/v1
          kind: Deployment
          name: myDeployment
          namespace: myNamespace
        # multiple resources for the readiness check to be performed on can be selected through labels
        # they are identified by their GVK and a set of labels that all need to match
        # required if no resourceSelector is specified, can be combined with a resourceSelector which is potentially harmful
        labelSelector:
          apiVersion: apps/v1
          kind: Deployment
          matchLabels:
            app: myApp
            component: backendService
        # requirements specifies what condition must hold true for the given objects to pass the readiness check
        # multiple requirements can be given and they all need to successfully evaluate
        requirements:
        # jsonPath denotes the path of the field of the selected object to be checked and compared
        - jsonPath: .status.readyReplicas
          # operator specifies how the contents of the given field should be compared to the desired value
          # allowed operators are: DoesNotExist(!), Exists(exists), Equals(=, ==), NotEquals(!=), In(in), NotIn(notIn)
          operator: In
          # values is a list of values that the field at jsonPath must match to according to the operators
          values:
          - value: 1
          - value: 2
          - value: 3
        # alternative cluster to get the resource values
        targetName: someOtherTargetName

    # Name of the release: helm install [name]
    name: my-release
    # Namespace of the release: helm --namespace
    namespace: default
    # configure the landscaper to automatically create the release namespace.
    # Works similar to "helm install --create-namespace"
    createNamespace: true
    # Values to template the chart
    # optional
    values:
      KeyA: valA

    # Define exports that are read from the kubernetes resources or helm values,
    # so they can be used by other deployitems or installations.
    # The deployer tries to read the export values until the timeout of the DeployItem (`spec.timeout`) is exceeded.
    exports:
      exports:
      - key: KeyA # value is read from the helm values
        jsonPath: .Values.keyA # points to the key in the helm values 
      - key: KeyB # value is read from a secret and exported with name "KeyB"
        jsonPath: .data.somekey # points to the value in the resource that is being exported
        fromResource: # required
          apiVersion: v1 # specification of the resource type
          kind: Secret
          name: my-secret # name of the resource
          namespace: a # namespace of the resource
      - key: KeyC # value is read from secret that is referenced by a service account and exported with name "KeyC"
        jsonPath: .secrets[0] # points to an object reference that consists of a name and namespace
        fromResource:
          apiVersion: v1 # specification of the resource type
          kind: ServiceAccount
          name: my-user # name of the resource
          namespace: a # namespace of the resource
        # Defines the referenced objects kind and version. 
        # The name and namespace is taken from the jsonPath defined in "fromResource".
        fromObjectRef:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Secret
          jsonPath: ".data.somekey" # points to the value in the resource that is being exported
```

Exports can be defined in `exportsFromManifests` by specifying the exported key to export.
The value is taken from a rendered resource and a jsonpath to the value.
For a complete documentation of the available jsonPath see here (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/).

:warning: Only unique identifiable resources (_apiVersion_, _kind_, _name_ and _namespace_).

If some values of k8s resources are exported, the default target of a DeployItem determines the cluster
from where these values are fetched. You can specify another `targetName`, which is used to get these values
from a different cluster. This is helpful if your DeployItem deploys something to some cluster which itself
deploys some stuff to a second cluster and your check requires to access the resources on this second cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: DeployItem
metadata:
  name: myDeployItemName
spec:
  ...
  
  target: 
    import: my-cluster

  config:
    ...
    
    exports:
      exports:
      - key: someKey
        jsonPath: .data.somekey 
        fromResource: 
          apiVersion: someVersion
          kind: someKind
          name: someName
          namespace: someNamespace
        # optional: other target cluster to fetch the export data  
        targetName: otherTargetName
```

## Manifest-Only Deployment

If you want to deploy the chart not with helm 3 but only apply the manifests you just need to add the field 
`helmDeployment: false` to the provider configuration as shown in the following example. 

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: DeployItem
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/helm

  target: # has to be of type landscaper.gardener.cloud/kubernetes-cluster
    name: my-cluster
    namespace: test

  config:
    apiVersion: helm.deployer.landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
    kind: ProviderConfiguration

    chart:
      ...

    # Specifies that only the rendered manifests are applied
    helmDeployment: false

    # Optional. Allows to customize the deletion behaviour for a manifest-only deployment
    deletionGroups: []
    # Optional. Allows to customize the deletion behaviour during update for a manifest-only deployment
    deletionGroupsDuringUpdate: []
```

The deletion behaviour for a manifest-only deployment is described in 
[Deletion of Manifest and Manifest-Only Helm DeployItems](./manifest_deletion.md).

## Provider Status

This section describes the provider specific status of the resource.

```yaml
status:
  providerStatus:
    apiVersion: helm.deployer.landscaper.gardener.cloud
    kind: ProviderStatus
    managedResources:
    - apiGroup: k8s.apigroup.com/v1
      kind: my-type
      name: my-resource
      namespace: default
```

## Deployer Configuration

When deploying the helm deployer controller it can be configured using the `--config` flag and providing a configuration file.

The structure of the provided configuration file is defined as follows.

:warning: Keep in mind that when deploying with the helm chart the configuration is abstracted using the helm values. 
See the [helm values file](../../charts/helm-deployer/values.yaml) for details when deploying with the helm chart.

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.deployer.landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
oci:
  # allow plain http connections to the oci registry.
  # Use with care as the default docker registry does not serve http with any authentication
  allowPlainHttp: false
  # skip the tls validation
  insecureSkipVerify: false
  # path to docker compatible auth configuration files.
#  configFiles:
#  - "somepath"

# target selector to only react on specific deploy items.
# see the common config in "./README.md" for detailed documentation.
targetSelector:
  annotations: []
  labels: []
```

## Support of Helm Chart Repositories

The example above requires that the helm chart is stored in an OCI registry, but also helm chart repositories are 
supported. There are two alternatives how to specify the helm chart: either directly in the provider configuration of 
the deploy item, or via a resource in a component descriptor.

#### Specifying a helm chart in the provider configuration

To read a chart from a helm chart repository, you can specify the repository URL, chart name, and chart version 
in field `chart.helmChartRepo` of the provider configuration, as in this example:

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: DeployItem
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  type: landscaper.gardener.cloud/helm

  config:
    apiVersion: helm.deployer.landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
    kind: ProviderConfiguration
    
    chart:
      helmChartRepo:
        helmChartRepoUrl: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
        helmChartName: nginx
        helmChartVersion: 9.7.1
    ...
```

The full example can be found 
[here](https://github.com/gardener/landscaper-examples/tree/master/helm-deployer/real-helm-deployment).

#### Specifying a helm chart via component descriptor

Alternatively, the provider configuration can reference a resource in the component descriptor.
Repository URL, chart name, and chart version are then specified in that resource in the component descriptor. 

Provider configuration:

```yaml
    chart:
      helmChartRepo:
        {{- $resource := getResource .cd "name" "nginx-chart" }}
        helmChartRepoUrl: {{ $resource.access.helmChartRepoUrl }}
        helmChartName:    {{ $resource.access.helmChartName }}
        helmChartVersion: {{ $resource.access.helmChartVersion }}
```

Component descriptor:

```yaml
meta:
  schemaVersion: 'v2'
component:
  name: 'github.com/gardener/landscaper-examples/helm-deployer/real-helm-deployment-cd'
  version: 'v0.1.0'
  ...
  resources:
    - type: helmChart
      name: nginx-chart
      version: 9.7.0
      relation: external
      access:
        type: helmChartRepository
        mediaType: application/octet-stream
        helmChartRepoUrl: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
        helmChartName: nginx
        helmChartVersion: 9.7.0
```

Note that the access type of the resource (field `access.type`) must be `helmChartRepository`.

The full example can be found 
[here](https://github.com/gardener/landscaper-examples/tree/master/helm-deployer/real-helm-deployment-cd).

#### Access to Helm Chart Repo with Authentication

If your helm chart repository is protected proceed as follows:

1) Create a [context CR](../usage/Context.md) in the same namespace as your installation.

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Context
metadata:
  name: helm-repo-protected
  namespace: example

repositoryContext:
  baseUrl: eu.gcr.io/gardener-project/landscaper/examples
  type: ociRegistry

registryPullSecrets: []

configurations:
  helmChartRepoCredentials:
    auths:
      - url: "your.protected.helmchart.repo.com"
        authHeader: "Basic dX3d...cmQ=" 
```

The field `repositoryContext` contains the base URL of your component repository. 

The field `configurations` contains an entry `helmChartRepoCredentials` with the URL and the authentication header of your 
protected helm chart repo (you might configure more than one).

You can specify the auth header either in the Context resource as shown in the example above, or alternatively in a 
Secret. If you use a Secret, it must belong to the same namespace as the Context, and the Context must contain a 
reference to the Secret. Here is an example:

Secret containing the auth header: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-helm-chart-repo-access
  namespace: example  # same namespace as the Context
stringData:
  authHeader: "Basic dX3d...cmQ="
```

Context with reference to the Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Context
metadata:
  name: helm-repo-protected
  namespace: example
...
configurations:
  helmChartRepoCredentials:
    auths:
      - url: "your.protected.helmchart.repo.com"
        secretRef: 
          name: my-helm-chart-repo-access  # name of the secret
          key:  authHeader                 # key of the item in the secret (optional, the default is "authHeader")
```

2) Use the context in your installation

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: helm-repo-protected
  namespace: example

spec:
  blueprint:
    ref:
      resourceName: blueprint

  context: helm-repo-protected

  componentDescriptor:
    ref:
      componentName: github.com/gardener/landscaper-examples/helm-deployer/helm-repo-protected
      version: v0.1.0
```

You can skip the field `repositoryContext` under `spec.componentDescriptor.ref` because this is fetched from the context
CR.

You find a complete example [here](https://github.com/gardener/landscaper-examples/tree/master/helm-deployer/helm-repo-protected).
