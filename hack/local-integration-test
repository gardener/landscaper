# Script executing the integration tests (without shoot cluster creation and deletion). It could be executed locally but
# is also called by the Gardener Concours jobs executing the integration tests.

# This script executes the following steps:
#
# - install-missing-software: Installs potentially missing software for the subsequent steps.
#
# - create-registry: Creates an OCI registry in a test shoot cluster. The kubeconfig for this cluster must be located
#   at the file path provided with $1.
#
# - install-landscaper: Installs the landscaper on the test shoot cluster. The landscaper version is provided by $2.
#
# - run-tests: Executes the integration tests on the test shoot cluster. The currently checkout state of the
#   integration tests is executed and not the state provided by the version in $2. $2 is only used in some integration tests
#   when a particular image is loaded.
