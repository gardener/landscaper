# This is a small helper script that takes a list of paths and unfolds them:
#   If the path ends with '/...', the path itself (without '/...') and all of its subfolders are printed.
#   Otherwise, only the path is printed.
#
# Paths that don't exist will cause an error.
#
# Options:
#
#   --absolute
#       If active, converts all paths to absolute paths. Overrides --clean.
#
#   --clean
#       If active, all paths are printed relative to the working directory, with './' and '../' resolved where possible.
#
#   --no-unfold
#       If active, does simply remove '/...' suffixes instead of unfolding the corresponding paths.
#
# Note that each option's flag
# - toggles that option between active and inactive (with inactive being the default when no flag for that option is specified)
# - can be used multiple times, toggling the option on and off as described above
# - affects only the paths that are specified after it in the command

# 'toggle X' flips $X between 'true' and 'false'.
