# Inline Blueprints

The Installations in this scenario can be used to test:

- inline blueprints: all Installations contain their blueprints inline;  

- the addition and removal of DeployItems: [installation-2.yaml](installation-2.yaml) 
  has three DeployItems (with dependencies), the other Installations have only one DeployItem;  

- the addition and removal of imports an exports: [installation-3.yaml](installation-3.yaml) has an import and export
  more than the other Installations.
